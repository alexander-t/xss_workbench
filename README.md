xss_workbench
=============

Simple application that contains XSS vulnerabilities.

I wrote this servlet/jsp application to try out basic version of XSS attacks.
It "supports", or rather illustrates both non-permanent and permanent XSS.

This code won't win any beauty contest, but it does its job. Also, the handling of the JDBC driver is flawed to save
time. Maybe I'll fix it sometime.
